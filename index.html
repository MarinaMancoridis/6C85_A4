    <h2><b>Proposition</b>: Between 1995 and 2019, the economic value of China’s rail system expanded at a rate that significantly surpassed that of the United States.</h2>

      <h3>FOR the Proposition</h3>

      <figure>

				<figcaption>
					This visualization plots the running sum of the average value of the railroads in China and the United States from 1995 to 2019. Trend lines in China are represented 
					in blue, whereas those in the United States are in orange. The chart includes contextual annotation in the form of text boxes. We can see that China's rail network experiences 
					an almost exponential surge in the running sum of passengers carried per kilometer, while the United States' trend is relatively stagnant.

			<p>
				<b>Design Decisions and Rationale</b>:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li><b>Rationale 1 (Data Transformation): </b> I made the decision to plot the <b>running sum</b> of the average value of the railroads. This intentionally misleads 
					the viewer into thinking that the growth in China's rail system value is exponential. <b>The cumulative sum naturally produces an exponential-like curve</b>, subtly 
					misleading the viewer into perceiving a steeper increase than what truly exists. I score this decision as <b><span style="color: green;">-1.5</span></b> because the 
					data transformation is inherently misleading in a way that requires careful analysis to recognize. </li>					
				<li><b>Rationale 2 (Textual Content): </b> Including factual content in text boxes enhances the perception that the visualization is well-researched. However, 
					the facts were selectively chosen to strengthen the argument—highlighting more positive aspects and higher-frequency data about China's rail system compared to the United States. I 
				score this decision as <b><span style="color: green;">-0.5</span></b> because, while the information is factual and adds valuable historical context to the illustration, 
				it is selectively presented in a way that introduces bias. </li>
				 </li>
				<li><b>Rationale 3 (Icons): </b>  The image features only two icons: a high-speed train emoji on the China line and a toy train emoji 
					on the United States line. This visual choice subtly suggests that the U.S. rail system is outdated or inferior compared to China’s, influencing the viewer’s 
					perception of their relative economic progress. I rate this decision <b><span style="color: green;">-0.5</span></b> because it subtly guides the reader toward a conclusion about 
					the two rail systems, though its impact remains relatively minor. </li>
				</li>
				<li><b>Rationale 4 (Summarization): </b> In the paragraph beneath the title, I explicitly summarize the conclusion the reader is "supposed" to draw from my visualization, using strategic 
					language—describing China’s growth as "an almost exponential surge" and the United States' trend as "relatively stagnant." This wording not only guides the reader toward a predetermined 
					interpretation rather than letting them form their own conclusions, but it is also factually misleading: it fails to mention that the visualization is based on a running sum, a 
					critical detail that is only subtly noted in italics under the left axis title. I rate this decision <b><span style="color: green;">-1.5</span></b> because it significantly misrepresents 
					the data while warping the viewer's perception. </li>
				<li>
					<b>Rationale 5 (Plot Type): </b> I chose a line chart to represent the data, a common and familiar type of visualization that is easy to interpret. This choice is meant to convince the viewer 
					that the data is straightforward and easy to understand, even though the running sum data transformation makes the visualization inherently misleading. I rate this decision <b><span style="color: green;">-0.5</span></b>
					because the line chart is a common and appropriate choice for this type of data, but it is used here to mask the underlying data transformation that makes the visualization deceptive. </li>
				</li>

      <h3>AGAINST the Proposition</h3>

      <figure>

				<figcaption>
				This visualization shows the percentage difference in average value of railways between consecutive years for China and the United States from 1995 to 2019. Although both China 
				and the United States a sharp drop-off in the percentage difference of the average railway value, the United States experienced the drop-off one year later. The visualization 
				is annotated with a green text box to provide a summarization of the drop-off point. 
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				<b>Design Decisions and Rationale</b>:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li><b>Rationale 1 (Data Transformation): </b> The most significant decision I made was to plot the percentage difference between consecutive years in the 
					average value of railways for China and the United States on the y-axis. This metric is intentionally difficult to interpret, and I further complicated 
					it by orienting the y-axis sideways and displaying details in small italics; these design choices <b>obscure the fact that the U.S. rail system consistently 
						had negative growth, while China’s was frequently above 0%</b>. I rate this decision <b><span style="color: green;">-1.5</span></b> because it makes 
						the data harder to understand and subtly hides a key comparison. </li>					
				<li><b>Rationale 2 (Chart Type): </b> Similarly to the last visualation, I chose a line chart to represent the data because it is a common and familiar type of chart. This choice 
					allows me to mask any deceptive design decisions under the guise of a simple and straightforward visualization. I rate this decision <b><span style="color: green;">-0.5</span></b>
					because the line chart is an appropriate choice for this type of data, but it is used here to hide the fact that the visualization is inherently misleading. </li>					
				<li><b>Rationale 3: </b> The emphasis on the drop-off point in the text and title distracts from a more critical trend: China consistently maintained positive growth, while 
					the U.S. was often below 0%. This framing shifts the reader’s focus away from the long-term disparity in growth and toward a single dramatic event. I rate this 
					decision <b><span style="color: green;">-1.0</span></b> because it doesn't misrepresent the data, but it does lead to a misleading interpretation.
			  </li>
				</li>
				<li><b>Rationale 4 (Summarization): </b> I guide the reader's interpretation in the sentence beneath the title, effectively drawing conclusions for them rather than letting them analyze the data 
					independently. To make matters more deceptive, throughout the text, I use misleading or vague terminology to frame the same information— for example, referring to changes as "growth momentum",
					or "investment in railway systems" to shape the reader's perception. I rate this decision <b><span style="color: green;">-1.5</span></b> because it significantly misrepresents the data while
					warping the viewer's perception. </li>
				<li><b>Rationale 5 (Data Omission): </b> I deliberately excluded a key data point—China's 2019 value—from the visualization; this omission is critical because the analysis relies on the narrative 
					that the U.S. trend plummeted a year later. If China had experienced a spike in 2019, it could have dramatically altered the perceived story. 
					I rate this decision <b><span style="color: green;">-2</span></b> because it significantly misrepresents the data and skews the viewer’s perception. </li>
				</li>
