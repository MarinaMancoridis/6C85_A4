			<p>
				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>RATIONALE_1: data transformation. running sum of average values is so misleading and would make a linear increase look exponential! didn't say average value of WHAT </li>
				<li>RATIONALE_2: textual content. cherry picked to make china look good. </li>
				<li>RATIONALE_3: use of emojis</li>
				<li>RATIONALE_4: told them off the bat exactly what to take away from the visualization </li>
				<li>RATIONALE_5: choice of the standard line plot was intentional! seems like it's very objective since it's familiar! </li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>RATIONALE_1: axis is the biggest thing. i made it hard to interpret. I call it something different in the title. i put the y-axis sideways and the key section in smaller italics</li>
				<li>RATIONALE_2: familiar type of chart without any additional clutter to make it obvious. </li>
				<li>RATIONALE_3: the focus on the drop-off point in all of the text and title hides the fact that China was consistently above 0% while the US was often below, meaning the US didn't really increase 
					but china did.
				</li>
				<li>RATIONALE_4: </li>
				<li>RATIONALE_5</li>
