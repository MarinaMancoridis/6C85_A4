    <h2>Proposition: Between 1995 and 2019, the economic value of China’s rail system expanded at a rate that significantly surpassed that of the United States.</h2>

			<p>
				<b>Design Decisions and Rationale</b>:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li><b>Rationale 1 (Data Transformation): </b> I made the decision to plot the <b>running sum</b> of the average value of the railroads. This intentionally misleads 
					the viewer into thinking that the growth in China's rail system value is exponential. <b>The cumulative sum naturally produces an exponential-like curve</b>, subtly 
					misleading the viewer into perceiving a steeper increase than what truly exists. I score this decision as <b><span style="color: green;">-1.5</span></b> because the 
					data transformation is inherently misleading in a way that requires careful analysis to recognize. </li>					
				<li><b>Rationale 2 (Textual Content): </b> Including factual content in text boxes enhances the perception that the visualization is well-researched. However, 
					the facts were selectively chosen to strengthen the argument—highlighting more positive aspects and higher-frequency data about China's rail system compared to the United States. I 
				score this decision as <b><span style="color: green;">-0.5</span></b> because, while the information is factual and adds valuable historical context to the illustration, 
				it is selectively presented in a way that introduces bias. </li>
				 </li>
				<li><b>Rationale 3 (Icons): </b>  The image features only two icons: a high-speed train emoji on the China line and a toy train emoji 
					on the United States line. This visual choice subtly suggests that the U.S. rail system is outdated or inferior compared to China’s, influencing the viewer’s 
					perception of their relative economic progress. I rate this decision <b><span style="color: green;">-0.5</span></b> because it subtly guides the reader toward a conclusion about 
					the two rail systems, though its impact remains relatively minor. </li>
			</li>
				<li><b>Rationale 4: </b> told them off the bat exactly what to take away from the visualization </li>
				<li><b>Rationale 5: </b> choice of the standard line plot was intentional! seems like it's very objective since it's familiar! </li>
			</ul>

				<b>Design Decisions and Rationale</b>:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li><b>Rationale 1: </b> axis is the biggest thing. i made it hard to interpret. I call it something different in the title. i put the y-axis sideways and the key section in smaller italics</li>
				<li><b>Rationale 2: </b> familiar type of chart without any additional clutter to make it obvious and to hide the fact that the chart stinks </li>
				<li><b>Rationale 3: </b> the focus on the drop-off point in all of the text and title hides the fact that China was consistently above 0% while the US was often below, meaning the US didn't really increase 
					but china did. in addition, the scale on the y-axis put all the atteniton on the drop and obscured the fact that the US was consistently below 0%.  </li>
				</li>
				<li><b>Rationale 4: </b> make the interpretation for you in the sentence underneath the title. misleading words throughout to represent the same information (growth momentum? investment in railway systems)</li>
				<li><b>Rationale 5: </b> ommitted information about China in 2018, which very well could have been higher than the US in that point! the whole argument pivots on this fact, which is purposely 
					left out haha so sneaky
				</li>

      <h2>Final Reflection</h2>

      <p>i found the process surprisingly similar for both activities.</p>
