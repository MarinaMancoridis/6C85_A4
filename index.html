				<b>Design Decisions and Rationale</b>:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li><b>Rationale 1: </b> data transformation. running sum of average values is so misleading and would make a linear increase look exponential! didn't say average value of WHAT </li>
				<li><b>Rationale 2: </b> textual content. cherry picked to make china look good. </li>
				<li><b>Rationale 3: </b> use of emojis</li>
				<li><b>Rationale 4: </b> told them off the bat exactly what to take away from the visualization </li>
				<li><b>Rationale 5: </b> choice of the standard line plot was intentional! seems like it's very objective since it's familiar! </li>

			<p>
				<b>Design Decisions and Rationale</b>:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li><b>Rationale 1: </b> axis is the biggest thing. i made it hard to interpret. I call it something different in the title. i put the y-axis sideways and the key section in smaller italics</li>
				<li><b>Rationale 2: </b> familiar type of chart without any additional clutter to make it obvious and to hide the fact that the chart stinks </li>
				<li><b>Rationale 3: </b> the focus on the drop-off point in all of the text and title hides the fact that China was consistently above 0% while the US was often below, meaning the US didn't really increase 
					but china did. in addition, the scale on the y-axis put all the atteniton on the drop and obscured the fact that the US was consistently below 0%.  </li>
				</li>
				<li><b>Rationale 4: </b> make the interpretation for you in the sentence underneath the title. misleading words throughout to represent the same information (growth momentum? investment in railway systems)</li>
				<li><b>Rationale 5: </b> ommitted information about China in 2018, which very well could have been higher than the US in that point! the whole argument pivots on this fact, which is purposely 
					left out haha so sneaky
				</li>
